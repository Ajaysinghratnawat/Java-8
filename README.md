# Java-8 Examples

A simple set of Java 8 feature demonstrations showing how to use functional interfaces and the Stream API. This repository includes basic examples of **Consumer**, **Function**, **Predicate**, **Supplier** and **Stream** usage in Java 8.
 
## 🚀 Overview

Java 8 introduced major enhancements to the language, including:

- Lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces
- Stream API for processing collections
- Improved default methods in interfaces  
(among many other features) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This repository is meant for beginners who want to explore these core Java 8 concepts with short, focused examples.
